    "summary": "Speech by Kate Collyer, FCA chief economist, at Warwick Business School, Financial Regulation in Support of the UK's Growth. Productivity in our sector has stalled over the past decade and UK economic growth has disappointed since the financial crisis.There are lots of ways to measure productivity. But if we look at the ten years since 2015, the annualised change in productivity was just 0.4%. That compared to 1.1% across the whole economy over the same period.And multifactor productivity in the UK financial services sector is more or less the same today as it was in 2006, despite the huge technological change that has taken place since then. The first iPhone launched in 2007 and in financial services, we’ve gone from 3 days to make international payments to being able to complete transfers almost instantly.And that raises a challenge for regulators: could we do more to adapt our approach, and so better promote productivity and growth within our sector?Risk is goodAppropriate risk-taki",

The proposals mirror many requirements which already apply to traditional financial firms, such as on operational resilience and systems and controls to fight crime.The rules aim to be proportionate, allowing UK firms to compete internationally.In recognition of some of the unique features of the cryptoasset market, the FCA has opened a discussion on how the Consumer Duty, which would require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for their consumers should apply to crypto. The regulator is also seeking views on how complaints should be managed, including whether consumers should be able to refer them to the Financial Ombudsman Service.David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance said: 'We want to develop a sustainable and competitive crypto sector – balancing innovation, market integrity and trust.

As part of the campaign, which will feature radio and online advertising, the FCA is teaming up with influencers, such as Cameron Smith (@cazza_time), to get the message to consumers.New research commissioned by the FCA shows that 79% of motor finance customers are aware that they may be owed compensation and 61% of a possible compensation scheme.However, 41% of those aware they may be owed compensation didn’t know they would not need to use a CMC or law firm if a redress scheme is introduced. Using a CMC or law firm to make a motor finance claim could cost consumers around 30% of any compensation paid. Of motor finance holders aware of the possibility of being owed compensation, 25% have already made a claim and a further 39% intend to. Among those who have alread",

Research by Lloyds Banking Group found that nearly 40% of fraud victims had lost confidence in online platforms.When people lose money to fraud, they understandably become more cautious. They lose trust in the system.And that has consequences, because trust is the foundation of growth.Without it, fewer people invest. Innovation slows and markets suffer.

    "summary": "Charles Hunter, Kayan Kalipha and Luke Desmaris appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court, each individually charged with an offence relating to their social media posts. The individuals – often referred to as ‘finfluencers’ – are alleged to have encouraged social media followers to invest in foreign exchange (forex or FX) trading through high-risk products known as contracts for difference, without having the authorisation to promote these investments.The charges follow the FCA’s announcement in June 2025 of a coordinated global enforcement action targeting illegal financial promotions by finfluencers across multiple jurisdictions. As part of that operation, the FCA authorised criminal proceedings against these three individuals.All three defendants pleaded not guilty and will appear at Southwark Crown Court for a hearing on 8 October 2025.Anyone who believes they have suffered loss in relation to this matter is encouraged to contact the FCA consumer contact centre on 0800 111 67",

Currently, only LSEG can use the rooftop of the data centre building for radio equipment used for LLCS. To address our competition concerns, LSEG and the landlord have proposed to offer equal access to the rooftop to others. The FCA’s competition investigationsLLCS providers build and operate high-speed connections between trading venues, which allow trading firms to process trades very quickly. Offering very fast connections is key to competition, and to maximise the speed of their connections, providers must be able to place radio units close to trading venues.The FCA’s investigations under competition law relate to the supply of LLCS between the LSE trading venue in London and 2 other trading venues in the UK: Cboe Europe and ICE.

Matthew West has been sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment, suspended for 2 years, along with an unpaid work requirement of 200 hours. Nikolas West has been sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.The brothers were both seasoned traders with over 20 years of experience within the UK and overseas, with an extensive network of contacts across the investment community. The FCA uncovered their misconduct through its market surveillance tools used to detect suspicious behaviour. A subsequent investigation found that within minutes of receiving confidential information, the brothers had coordinated and executed trades, making a profit of £44,164.36.However, the court has ordered them to pay back more than £280,000 – reflecting the full value of the shares traded through their criminal conduct, not just the profit they made.

The updated taxonomy reflects the latest developments in international financial reporting, including the introduction of IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ and IFRS 19 ‘Subsidiaries Without Public Accountability’. These standards are currently undergoing the EU endorsement process, expected to be finalised in early 2026.

Geopolitical events continue to have a strong impact on the evolution of financial markets. In the first half of 2025 securities markets experienced pronounced volatility as global uncertainties intensified, notably with escalating trade conflicts. Investor risks have also risen in crypto-asset markets, where exuberance has been fuelled by political developments in the US and the emergence of new, high-risk business models. Overall, ESMA sees high or very high risks in the markets within its remit, and retail and institutional investors should remain alert to potential sharp market corrections, and to the liquidity strains they could entail.

The new VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage. Technical ",

We announced the investigation into WCL in 2022 following Wellesley Finance Ltd (WFL), an unregulated entity, entering into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors in October 2020. At the time of WFL’s CVA, around 12,000 investors were owed £134.7m. About £80m has been returned to investors but, unfortunately, some investors have lost all that they invested. The investigation's focus was whether investors had been given misleading information and defrauded by WCL. It found that the risks were fairly described to investors and there were no signs of fraud.Background to the investigation WCL promoted and arranged high-risk investments that related to property development. These products were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).WCL was responsible for approving financial promotions used to market certa",

    "summary": "Motor insurers have changed their settlement and compensation practices after the FCA found some insurers had short-changed customers on stolen or written off vehicle claims. It means that an estimated 270,000 motorists are expected to receive £200m in compensation for historic claims that were underpaid, breaching rules on handling claims fairly. Of this, £129m has been paid to date to almost 150,000 customers.The FCA has carried out detailed work with insurers, following an initial review last year, which found that in some cases, automatic deductions to payouts were made for assumed pre-existing damage. This particularly disadvantaged careful drivers who had looked after their vehicles and made it hard for them to buy like-for-like replacements. Insurers have now overhauled their claims processes in line with the regulator’s Consumer Duty.Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said:'We’ll step in when consumers aren’t getting fair value - and we are pleased to see that ",
