Productivity in our sector has stalled over the past decade and UK economic growth has disappointed since the financial crisis.There are lots of ways to measure productivity. But if we look at the ten years since 2015, the annualised change in productivity was just 0.4%. That compared to 1.1% across the whole economy over the same period.And multifactor productivity in the UK financial services sector is more or less the same today as it was in 2006, despite the huge technological change that has taken place since then. The first iPhone launched in 2007 and in financial services, we’ve gone from 3 days to make international payments to being able to complete transfers almost instantly.And that raises a challenge for regulators: could we do more to adapt our approach, and so better promote productivity and growth within our sector?Risk is goodAppropriate risk-taki",

As part of the campaign, which will feature radio and online advertising, the FCA is teaming up with influencers, such as Cameron Smith (@cazza_time), to get the message to consumers.New research commissioned by the FCA shows that 79% of motor finance customers are aware that they may be owed compensation and 61% of a possible compensation scheme.However, 41% of those aware they may be owed compensation didn’t know they would not need to use a CMC or law firm if a redress scheme is introduced. Using a CMC or law firm to make a motor finance claim could cost consumers around 30% of any compensation paid.

A small-scale scam here, a phishing email there. Non-violent, technical, almost victimless.After more than 30 years in national security and law enforcement, I can tell you that’s a dangerous misunderstanding.I’ve seen up close how it directly fuels some of the most serious crime: human trafficking, terrorism, hostile state activity.And financial crime doesn’t just steal money – it also steals confidence. Research by Lloyds Banking Group found that nearly 40% of fraud victims had lost confidence in online platforms.When people lose money to fraud, they understandably become more cautious. They lose trust in the system.And that has consequences, because trust is the foundation of growth.Without it, fewer people invest. Innovation slows and markets suffer.
