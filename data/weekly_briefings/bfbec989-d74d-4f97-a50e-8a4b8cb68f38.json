We observed 0 high-impact items requiring rapid assessment.\n\nThe Big Picture\nRegulators remain focused on risk management, operational resilience, and consumer protections. Cross-market expectations are converging around more prescriptive controls.\n\nWhat Changed Since Last Week\nThe volume of high-impact items shifted modestly, with notable increases in enforcement notices and implementation guidance updates.\n\nKey Storylines\n• Compliance obligations related to resilience testing are gathering pace.\n• Market conduct authorities emphasised consumer outcomes and disclosure standards.\n• Enforcement teams escalated investigations with new fines announced across banking and securities.\n\nLooking Ahead\nExpect further clarity on implementation deadlines next week as authorities finalise consultation responses and signal additional enforcement sweeps.",
