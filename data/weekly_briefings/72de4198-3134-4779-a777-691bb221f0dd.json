The FCA estimates people would receive around £700 per agreement, on average. Based on the number of consumers the FCA estimates could take part in the scheme, lenders could pay out £8.2 billion in compensation.Motor finance companies broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. This led to unfairness, with consumers denied the chance to negotiate or find a better deal and, in some instances, paying more for their loan. A compensation scheme is the best, most efficient way of getting compensation to those owed it and would make it simpler for those who would otherwise struggle to claim. Research commissioned by the FCA shows almost half of those aware of possible compensation, but who had not yet made a claim, (46%) cite a lack of clarity on whether a claim would be eligible as a barrier, and n",

This would result in significantly higher administrative and legal costs for firms and consumers, lengthy delays and uncertain outcomes for all involved.Why are we proposing a scheme?Many firms broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information.

The new “single” VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage.  As a reminder, the previous double volume cap no longer applies.

Pugh, aged 35, set up a Ponzi scheme with another individual that netted over £1m. Run from his bedroom in Devon, the fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF) took money from 238 investors Pugh targeted largely through Facebook adverts. Investors were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.Pugh received £96,000 from the scheme. He used the money to support his lifestyle, including designer clothes, restaurants and withdrawing £18,000 in cash.The returns investors were promised did not materialise. Pugh duped investors into believing he was successfully trading and their money was safe. Even at the point he knew the scheme was collapsing, Pugh continued to try to attract more investors into the scheme.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'Pugh made outlandish claims",

    "narrative": "Why This Week Matters\n\nThis week's regulatory updates cover a range of significant developments across the financial services sector, from compensation schemes for unfair motor finance agreements to new guidance on crypto-asset regulation and market infrastructure changes. These updates signal an active regulatory environment focused on consumer protection, market integrity, and enabling innovation.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nThe updates this week reflect the FCA's ongoing efforts to ensure fair outcomes for consumers, with the proposed motor finance compensation scheme being a key focus. Regulators are also working to enhance the crypto-asset regulatory framework and promote smarter, more efficient data management and reporting. Additionally, the Bank of England and ESMA are making changes to market infrastructure, such as the switch to a single volume cap mechanism and updates to the IFRS taxonomy.\n\nWhat Changed Since Last Week\n\nThis week's updates build on previous regulatory actions, such as the FCA's ongoing work on consumer protection and the Bank of England's efforts to manage foreign currency reserves. The new developments include the FCA's launch of a £1 million awareness campaign for the motor finance compensation scheme, ESMA's publication of the first single volume cap data, and the FRC's consultations on enhancing auditing standards and enforcement procedures.\n\nKey Storylines\n\n1. Consumer Protection: The FCA's proposed motor finance compensation scheme and associated awareness campaign demonstrate the regulator's commitment to ensuring fair outcomes for consumers who were treated unfairly by lenders. This aligns with the FCA's broader focus on the Consumer Duty and improving financial inclusion.\n\n2. Crypto-asset Regulation: The EU Supervisory Authorities' warning to consumers about the risks and limited protections for certain crypto-assets highlights the ongoing regulatory efforts to establish a consistent supervisory regime for this evolving market segment.\n\n3. Market Infrastructure: The changes to the volume cap mechanism and IFRS taxonomy signal ESMA and the Bank of England's work to enhance the efficiency and transparency of financial markets, supporting the broader goals of market integration and innovation.\n\n4. Regulatory Simplification and Burden Reduction: Initiatives such as ESMA's Data Day and the FCA's continued efforts to streamline data reporting requirements demonstrate the regulators' focus on reducing unnecessary burdens on firms while maintaining effective oversight.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe regulatory landscape continues to evolve, with a focus on consumer protection, market integrity, and enabling innovation. Firms should expect further developments in areas such as crypto-asset regulation, sustainability-linked financing, and the ongoing simplification of compliance requirements. Engagement with regulators and staying informed on these key storylines will be crucial for firms to navigate the changing environment effectively.",
