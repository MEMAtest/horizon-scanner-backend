We’ve engaged with a range of market participants – including buy-side and sell-side firms, financial market infrastructures, and trade associations – to understand how preparations are progressing and where challenges remain.T+1 will reduce the time you have to process your transactions by around 80%.Planning early will be crucial.

Following that announcement, ITM’s share price fell by around 37%.The day before the announcement, Mr Dwane used the inside information and sold his own and a family member’s 125,000 shares worth £124,287. He took advantage of the subsequent fall in ITM’s share price to purchase 180,000 shares worth £140,700, gaining £26,575 from the price difference.Mr Dwane is an experienced financial professional and knew his conduct amounted to insider dealing, abusing his position of trust.Mr Dwane was required to obtain ITM’s permission before dealing in its shares, but he failed to do so.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'As an experienced financial ",

In 2022, Mr Dwane worked as an advisor for ITM Power Plc (ITM). Because of his role, Mr Dwane knew the details of an announcement ITM planned to make to the market on 27 October. Following that announcement, ITM’s share price fell by around 37%.The day before the announcement, Mr Dwane used the inside information and sold his own and a family member’s 125,000 shares worth £124,287. He took advantage of the subsequent fall in ITM’s share price to purchase 180,000 shares worth £140,700, gaining £26,575 from the price difference.Mr Dwane is an experienced financial professional and knew his conduct amounted to insider dealing, abusing his position of trust.Mr Dwane was required to obtain ITM’s permission before dealing in its shares, but he failed to do so.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'As an experienced financial ",

The change is designed to improve market efficiency, reduce risk and align the UK with global settlement standards.While the initiative is market led, we’ll play our part in making sure firms and trading venues are prepared. We’ve engaged with a range of market participants – including buy-side and sell-side firms, financial market infrastructures, and trade associations – to understand how preparations are progressing and where challenges remain.T+1 will reduce the time you have to process your transactions by around 80%.Planning early will be crucial.

This led to unfairness, with consumers denied the chance to negotiate or find a better deal and, in some instances, paying more for their loan. A compensation scheme is the best, most efficient way of getting compensation to those owed it and would make it simpler for those who would otherwise struggle to claim.

The new “single” VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage.  As a reminder, the previous double volume cap no longer applies.

Pugh, aged 35, set up a Ponzi scheme with another individual that netted over £1m. Run from his bedroom in Devon, the fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF) took money from 238 investors Pugh targeted largely through Facebook adverts. Investors were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.Pugh received £96,000 from the scheme. He used the money to support his lifestyle, including designer clothes, restaurants and withdrawing £18,000 in cash.The returns investors were promised did not materialise. Pugh duped investors into believing he was successfully trading and their money was safe. Even at the point he knew the scheme was collapsing, Pugh continued to try to attract more investors into the scheme.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'Pugh made outlandish claims",

Beyond the changes directly originating from MiFID II – such as the requirement to publish two weekly reports and the exclusion of (spot) emission allowances from position reporting – the updated XML schema and reporting instructions also include other amendments to ITS 4, like the harmonisation of reporting units for energy derivatives. The adjustments are based on ESMA’s Final Report submitted to the European Commission in December 2024, which is currently pending adoption. ESMA has opted for this approach to ensure a consistent reporting framework and minimise the need f",

A consumer accessing tax-free cash in itself does not trigger cancellation rights under our rules.Our rules do not exempt firms from HMRC requirements.

Many of the firms offering these products don’t need to be authorised by the FCA, as they rely on exemptions in the law that take them out of our remit.If a firm offering an investment is not regulated by the FCA there are generally far fewer protections. For example, you are unlikely to be able to take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service and you’re unlikely to be able to make a claim through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
