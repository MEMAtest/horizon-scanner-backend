CFDs are a way to bet on the price of a share or asset moving up or down without owning it. The FCA is concerned that firms are using high-pressure techniques to encourage investors to claim they are professional clients, putting them at risk of losing more money than they can afford.The retail client protections, including leverage limits and client loss protections, prevent nearly 400,000 people a year from risking more than their original stake in CFDs and provide between £267m and £451m worth of protection.The FCA has also found investors are being targeted by finfluencers, who may not make it clear that they are promoting unregulated firms operating offshore. Some of these finfluencers promise consumers unrealistic returns if they copy trades, invest in managed accounts or pay for daily trading tips.

Following that announcement, ITM’s share price fell by around 37%.The day before the announcement, Mr Dwane used the inside information and sold his own and a family member’s 125,000 shares worth £124,287. He took advantage of the subsequent fall in ITM’s share price to purchase 180,000 shares worth £140,700, gaining £26,575 from the price difference.Mr Dwane is an experienced financial professional and knew his conduct amounted to insider dealing, abusing his position of trust.Mr Dwane was required to obtain ITM’s permission before dealing in its shares, but he failed to do so.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'As an experienced financial ",

We’ve engaged with a range of market participants – including buy-side and sell-side firms, financial market infrastructures, and trade associations – to understand how preparations are progressing and where challenges remain.T+1 will reduce the time you have to process your transactions by around 80%.Planning early will be crucial.

ESMA is encouraging stakeholders to share their views about the elements that a CCP should consider when      establishing its admission criteria, and assessing the ability of non-financial counterparties acting as clearing members to meet margin requirements and default fund contributions.  All interested stakeholders are invited to provide input to the consultation. In particular, responses are sought from CCPs and direct or indirect participants of CCPs (as well as potential participants of CCPs), both financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties.

The FCA estimates people would receive around £700 per agreement, on average. Based on the number of consumers the FCA estimates could take part in the scheme, lenders could pay out £8.2 billion in compensation.Motor finance companies broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. This led to unfairness, with consumers denied the chance to negotiate or find a better deal and, in some instances, paying more for their loan. A compensation scheme is the best, most efficient way of getting compensation to those owed it and would make it simpler for those who would otherwise struggle to claim. Research commissioned by the FCA shows almost half of those aware of possible compensation, but who had not yet made a claim, (46%) cite a lack of clarity on whether a claim would be eligible as a barrier, and n",

The new “single” VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage.  As a reminder, the previous double volume cap no longer applies.

Pugh, aged 35, set up a Ponzi scheme with another individual that netted over £1m. Run from his bedroom in Devon, the fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF) took money from 238 investors Pugh targeted largely through Facebook adverts. Investors were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.Pugh received £96,000 from the scheme. He used the money to support his lifestyle, including designer clothes, restaurants and withdrawing £18,000 in cash.The returns investors were promised did not materialise. Pugh duped investors into believing he was successfully trading and their money was safe. Even at the point he knew the scheme was collapsing, Pugh continued to try to attract more investors into the scheme.Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'Pugh made outlandish claims",
