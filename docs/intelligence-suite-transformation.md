# Intelligence Suite Transformation Blueprint

## Executive Summary
Transform the Intelligence Center, Authority Spotlight, and Sector Intelligence pages from isolated, list-driven views into an integrated decision system. Each page must:

- Enable users to triage, collaborate, and act directly on the page.
- Generate a tailored, export-ready report (e.g., Intelligence Center Alert Pack, Authority Momentum Brief, Sector Risk Sheet).
- Feed structured insights into the Weekly Smart Briefing so Haiku can stitch narrative, change-map, and sector-risk sections automatically.

## Current Pain Points
| Category | Issue | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redundant Data | Same updates surface in multiple areas with little context | Users re-read information without clarity on what changed |
| Fragmented Journey | No guidance on which page to use for what scenario | Analysts lack a clear workflow; executives don‚Äôt know where to look |
| Static Displays | Metrics and lists don‚Äôt suggest next steps | Decisions stall; annotations live in notebooks instead of the platform |
| Weak Integration | Authority & Sector views don‚Äôt enrich Weekly Brief | Weekly narrative feels detached from daily intelligence |
| Unclear Value | Each page‚Äôs unique purpose is ambiguous | Adoption suffers; stakeholders question why to revisit the pages |

## Guiding Principles
1. **Action First:** Every insight should have an obvious next step (flag, assign, annotate, add to report).
2. **Report on Demand:** Each module must export a concise, audience-ready briefing derived from current filters.
3. **Continuous Storytelling:** Flagged insights, momentum deltas, and pressure signals should flow into Weekly Smart Briefing prompts automatically.
4. **Telemetry & Governance:** Track who flagged, annotated, exported, and ensure auditability for compliance.

### Phase 1 Execution Plan (Week 0‚Äë1)
_Detailed artefacts are captured in `docs/phase-1-experience-mapping.md`._
**Objectives**
- Validate the personas, journey flows, and data stories that will anchor the Intelligence Center, Authority Spotlight, and Sector Intelligence experiences.
- Produce share-ready report templates and confirm the API contracts required to populate them.

**Workstreams**

| Workstream | Key Activities | Primary Owner(s) | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Persona & Scenario Alignment | Confirm primary personas, clarify their core jobs-to-be-done, finalize triage vs. insight consumption scenarios. | Product + UX | Persona brief, prioritized scenarios with success metrics. |
| Journey Mapping | Map end-to-end flows (ingest ‚Üí triage ‚Üí action ‚Üí reporting) for each persona, including cross-page handoffs. | UX + Ops SMEs | Annotated journey maps, gap list for Phase 2 user stories. |
| Report Template Definition | Draft Intelligence Center Report, Authority Momentum Brief, Sector Risk Brief templates with data slots and narrative prompts. | Product Marketing + Data | Low-fidelity templates, content checklists, prompt stub library. |
| Data Contract & API Audit | Inventory current data availability, identify missing fields (e.g., `persona_relevance`, `report_included`), document required schema changes. | Engineering + Data | Updated API contract, backlog tickets for schema updates. |

**Timeline & Ceremonies**
- Day 0: Kickoff workshop (120 mins) aligning objectives and reviewing existing assets.
- Day 1-2: Parallel workstream sessions; daily 30-minute stand-up to surface blockers.
- Day 3: Draft readouts circulated asynchronously for feedback.
- Day 4: Playback session to ratify personas, journeys, and template structures.
- Day 5: Finalize consolidated Phase 1 packet; log tickets for Phase 2 dependencies.

**Inputs Needed**
- Latest persona research, engagement analytics, and qualitative feedback.
- Current annotation service schema and report generation capabilities.
- Haiku prompt catalog and any existing triage or reporting prompts.

**Exit Criteria**
- Shared persona and journey artefacts signed off by Product, UX, Ops, and Engineering leads.
- Approved report templates with mapped data fields and prompt placeholders.
- API/data contract updates captured as backlog items with sizing and ownership.
- Risks, assumptions, and open questions recorded for Phase 2 discovery.

**Risks & Mitigations**
- Misalignment on audience expectations ‚Üí mitigate with joint kickoff and midweek playback.
- Gaps in data availability ‚Üí flag in audit doc and prioritize schema tickets before Phase 2.
- Limited stakeholder availability ‚Üí schedule ceremonies in advance and enable async reviews.

## Data & Tech Requirements
- **Data Pipelines:**
  - Momentum calculations (rolling counts, topic NLP clustering, coordination links).
  - Sector pressure scoring (frequency, consultation metadata, deadlines, weighted by impact).
  - Annotation/action metadata fields (`origin_page`, `report_included`, `assigned_to`).
- **APIs:**
  - Flag/Assign endpoints to update annotation service.
  - Report export endpoints (async job returning URL/PDF).
  - Alerts subscription endpoints (sector/authority watch).
  - Metrics endpoint expansion for action counts.
- **Prompt Updates:**
  - Week‚Äôs Story prompt to accept flagged item clusters + manual notes.
  - Change Map prompt to ingest momentum data, output structured change categories.
  - Team Briefing prompt to include pressure thresholds + assignments.
  - Page-specific report prompts (center/authority/sector) for on-demand outputs.

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption:**
  - Weekly flag count per persona.
  - Reports generated per page per week.
  - Alert acknowledgements within SLA.
- **Narrative Quality:**
  - % of Weekly Brief sections sourced from page actions.
  - Exec satisfaction scores from report recipients.
- **Operational Velocity:**
  - Time from update ingestion to triage flag/assignment.
  - Time from pressure spike to alert acknowledgement.
- **Governance:**
  - Audit log completeness (who flagged/exported/acknowledged).
  - Prompt output QA (manual review pass rate).

## Open Questions for Implementation AI
1. What weighting schema should be used for sector pressure gauges (mentions vs. deadlines vs. consultations)?
2. Which visualization library aligns with existing stack for gauges and radars?
3. Preferred report formats (PDF vs. HTML vs. email) and delivery channels?
4. Do we need role-based access controls for annotations/actions beyond current auth?
5. How to integrate alerting (email, Slack, in-app) within existing infrastructure?

## Next Steps
1. Validate this blueprint with product/UX stakeholders.
2. Green-light Phase 1 tasks (journey mapping, template drafting).
3. Lock prompt versioning strategy before coding Phase 2 work.
4. Prepare data samples for momentum/pressure calculations to test Haiku outputs.
